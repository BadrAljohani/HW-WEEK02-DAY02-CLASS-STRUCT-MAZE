# Classes & Structs (Maze) Homework

## Walk through the MAZE

### You have a maze of size 2x2

### Create a class/struct that has properties like currentPosition, isWall, isStart, isVisited

### Create functions to move the person in the maze in all directions and complete the path.

#### Functions can be like goRight, goLeft, goBottom, goTop, isComplete

##### Hint: Try to use arrays, struct/classes, properties and initializers. 

##### Note: Feel free to add/change the variables as you need. Evaluation for this task is not just about completion but to see how you genuinely attempt to use different concepts you've learnt.
